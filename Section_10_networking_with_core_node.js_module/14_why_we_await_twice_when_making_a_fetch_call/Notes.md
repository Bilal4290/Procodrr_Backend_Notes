1️⃣ Why Does await response.text() Not Resolve Without socket.end()?

    When you send data using socket.write('\r\n\r\n{"name":"Coder"}') without calling socket.end(), the client (browser) expects more data because:

    ⭐ TCP is a stream-based protocol, meaning there is no inherent "end of message" signal.
    ⭐ fetch() waits for the entire response to complete before resolving await response.text().
    ⭐ Since the connection remains open, the browser keeps waiting for more data, thinking there is still more coming.

    👉 Solution: Call socket.end() after sending the response to indicate that the transmission is complete.

2️⃣ Why Does for await(const chunk of response.body) Work Even Without socket.end()?

    Unlike response.text(), using streams (response.body) allows the browser to start processing data as soon as it arrives without waiting for the full response.

    How Does Streaming Work?

    ⭐ When the server writes a chunk, the client receives it immediately.
    ⭐ for await(const chunk of response.body) processes each chunk as it arrives.
    ⭐ The connection remains open, but the browser doesn't get stuck waiting for the entire response.
    ⭐ This is similar to how ChatGPT streams responses as they are generated rather than waiting for the entire answer.

    👉 Benefit: Faster user experience since the browser can start processing data before the full response is received.

    👉 Downside: If the server does not properly send a complete JSON, you may get incomplete or invalid JSON (e.g., JSON.parse() error).

    👉 Frontend Code:

        const response = await fetch('https://ip:port')
        console.log(response)
        const decoder = new TextDecoder()
        for await(const chunk of response.body){
            console.log(JSON.parse(decoder.decode(chunk)))
        }

3️⃣ Why Does ChatGPT Stream Responses Instead of Waiting for Full Completion?

    When you ask a question in ChatGPT:

    ⭐ The backend starts sending chunks of text immediately rather than waiting for the full response.
    ⭐ The frontend (for await(const chunk of response.body)) renders each chunk as it arrives.
    ⭐ This improves user experience because you start reading the response without waiting for the entire answer.



🔑 Key Takeaways:

    ❌ Bad Practice	                                                  ✅ Best Practice
    Not calling socket.end(), making the client wait forever.	        Call socket.end() when done.
    Using await response.text(), which waits for the entire response.	Use for await (const chunk of response.body).
    Manually pausing/resuming stream with setTimeout().	                Use socket.on('drain',() => readStream.resume()).
    Sending JSON without ensuring it's complete.	                    Buffer JSON chunks and parse at the end.


🚀 Summary:

    ⭐ await response.text() waits for the entire response, so you must call socket.end().
    ⭐ Streaming (for await (chunk of response.body)) processes data instantly, allowing better performance.
    ⭐ Proper backpressure handling (socket.write(chunk) with socket.on('drain')) ensures smooth data flow.
    ⭐ ChatGPT streams data in chunks to improve user experience, which is what you're trying to achieve.
