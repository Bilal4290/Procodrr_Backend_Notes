üìå Understanding TCP Server in Node.js Using the net Module:

    The net module in Node.js allows us to create TCP servers and clients. In this explanation, I will cover everything in full detail, including how TCP connections work, what headers are involved, and why certain behaviors occur.


1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a TCP Server:

    How do we create a TCP server?
    We use the net.createServer() method:

        import net from 'node:net';
        const server = net.createServer();

    What does createServer() return?

        createServer() returns a TCP server instance, which is an EventEmitter.
        This means we can attach event listeners to handle incoming connections, data, and errors.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Starting the TCP Server:

    To start the server, we call the .listen(port) method:

        server.listen(4000);

    How do we know when the server starts?

        The listening event is triggered when the server starts successfully:

            server.on('listening', () => {
                console.log('Server is started on port 4000');
            });


3Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding TCP Connection and the Three-Way Handshake:

    How does a client connect to the server?

        üìå When a client tries to connect:

            The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet.
            The server responds with SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge).
            The client replies with an ACK (acknowledge).

        ‚úÖ After this three-way handshake, the connection is established, and the connection event fires on the server.

            server.on('connection', (socket) => {
                console.log('Server and client connected.');
            });


        üìå How can we see this in Wireshark?

            Open Wireshark and start capturing packets.
            Apply a filter: tcp.port == 4000.
            You'll see three packets (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) when a client connects.


4Ô∏è‚É£ How does the Server Receive Data from the Client?

    üìå When the client sends data, it arrives at the server. The data event is triggered:

        server.on('connection', (socket) => {
            socket.on('data', (chunk) => {
                console.log('Received from client:', chunk.toString());
            });
        });

        Socket is a duplex stream.


    üìå What is the PSH (Push) Flag?

        When the client sends data, the PSH (push) flag is set in the TCP header.
        Purpose: It tells the server to process the received data immediately instead of waiting for more data.
        You can also see this in Wireshark.


5Ô∏è‚É£ How to Send a Message from Server to Client?

    In TCP, both client and server must have sockets because sockets are the communication endpoints.
    The server's socket is received in the connection event callback.
    The socket is a duplex stream, meaning it can read and write.

    üìå Sending a Response to Client:

        server.on('connection', (socket) => {
            socket.on('data', (chunk) => {
                console.log('Received:', chunk.toString());
                socket.write('Message received by server.');
            });
        });


    üìå How to Get Client Information?

        console.log(socket.remoteAddress);  // Client's IP address
        console.log(socket.remotePort);     // Client's Port
        console.log(socket.address());      // Server's IP and Port


6Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Client Disconnection:

    When the client disconnects, the close event fires:

        server.on('connection', (socket) => {
            socket.on('close', () => {
                console.log('Client disconnected.');
            });
        });



7Ô∏è‚É£ Why Do We See Two Requests in Wireshark When Sending a Message?

    When a client sends a message, we see two requests:

    Client ‚Üí Server (Message)
    Server ‚Üí Client (Acknowledgment that data was received)
    Each TCP segment contains sequence numbers and ACK numbers to ensure data integrity.


8Ô∏è‚É£ What Happens When We Send a Request from a Browser to a TCP Server?

    Browsers make HTTP requests, not raw TCP requests.
    Since our server is pure TCP, the browser sends a request but doesn‚Äôt receive a valid HTTP response.
    ‚úÖ We see two requests in Wireshark:

        One for the favicon.ico (Browsers automatically request this).
        One for the actual HTTP request.

    üìå Solution: If you want the TCP server to handle HTTP requests, you need to send an HTTP response.

        server.on('connection', (socket) => {
            socket.on('data', (chunk) => {
                console.log('Received:', chunk.toString());
                socket.write('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nGot your message.');
            });
        });



9Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding TCP Headers (Important for Backend Development):

    Every TCP packet has a header, which contains important information:

    Field	                            Description
    Source Port	                        Port of the sender
    Destination Port	                Port of the receiver
    Sequence Number	                    Tracks the order of packets
    ACK Number	                        Acknowledges received data
    Flags (SYN, ACK, PSH, FIN)	        Controls connection state
    Window Size	                        How much data can be received before ACK
    Checksum	                        Ensures data integrity
