=>   Types of executable files :

          (1)  Script executable files
          (2)  Binary executable files


=>   Script executable files :

       Koi bhi aisi text file jis ka name hum terminal mai likh kar run kar sakain.     ./fileName

       Koi bhi file jis k andar koi command likhi ho ussay hum executable file keh saktay hain lekin saari files executable files nahi hain.Wohi files executable files hain jin ko execute permission hai.

       extension also not matters.

       But industry standard is :

       file for windows :   abc.bat

       file for bash    : abc.sh

       How to run these script executable files =>  ./abc.sh


=>    Binary executable files :

        Files with .exe extensions are binary executable files.

        Also works in powershell by adding '&' operator before path.
