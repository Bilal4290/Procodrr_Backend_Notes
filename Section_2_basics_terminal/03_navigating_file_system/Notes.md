=>  cd - Change Directory:

         Used to navigate between directories.

        Syntax:
            cd [directory]

        Examples:

            cd /home/username/Documents : Navigate to the "Documents" directory.
            cd .. : Go up one level to the parent directory.
            cd ~ : Navigate to your home directory.
            cd / : Navigate to the root directory.
            cd - : Switches back to the previous directory you were in.



=>  Absolute vs Relative Paths:

        Absolute Path: Full path from the root (/), e.g., /home/user/Documents.
        Relative Path: Path relative to your current directory, e.g., Documents if you're in /home/user/.



=>  ls - List Directory Contents:

        Lists files and directories in the current directory.

        Common options:

           ls -l : Detailed list with permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
           ls -a : Includes hidden files (those starting with a dot .).
                   Files that start with a dot (.) are hidden (e.g., .bashrc).
           ls -lh: Detailed list with human-readable file sizes.
