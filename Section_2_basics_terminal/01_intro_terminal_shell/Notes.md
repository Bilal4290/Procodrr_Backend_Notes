=>   Why we need terminal ?

       When we make a backend application, then host on server, then we access to that backend application through terminal.

       As we open different tabs in a browser, same we open different shells in a terminal.

       In windows, we have different shells:
          (1)  Windows powershell
          (2)  Azure cloud shell

       In linux, we have git bash shell.

       Note : 
              We take terminal as a browser and shell as a website.



=>       Terminal vs Shell :

            Purpose :
            
                Terminal provides a user interface while shell interprets commands.

            
            Functionality :

                 Terminal displays outputs and accepts inputs while shell executes commands.


            Layering :

                 Shell runs inside a terminal.


            Examples of terminal :

                 (1)  Terminal           =>    Mac
                 (2)  Command Prompt     =>    Windows


               
            Examples of Shell :
             
                (1)  Bash shell
                (2)  Powershell
