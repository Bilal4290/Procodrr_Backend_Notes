In Node.js (and JavaScript in general), you can work with binary numbers using several methods. Here's a quick guide on handling binary numbers:

1. Binary Literals (ES6+):
From ECMAScript 6 (ES6), binary literals can be represented using the 0b prefix.

        Example:

        let binaryNumber = 0b1010; // equivalent to decimal 10
        console.log(binaryNumber); // Output: 10


2. Using parseInt():
You can convert a string representation of a binary number to a decimal number using the parseInt() function. Pass 2 as the second argument to indicate that the base is binary.

        Example:

        let binaryString = '1010';
        let decimalNumber = parseInt(binaryString, 2); // '1010' in binary is 10 in decimal
        console.log(decimalNumber); // Output: 10


3. Converting Decimal to Binary:
To convert a decimal number to its binary representation, use the toString() method with 2 as the argument.

        Example:

        let decimalNumber = 10;
        let binaryNumber = decimalNumber.toString(2);
        console.log(binaryNumber); // Output: 1010


4. Working with Binary in Math Operations:
Just like other number systems, binary numbers can be used in mathematical operations since JavaScript internally treats them as base-10 numbers.

        Example:

        let binary1 = 0b1010; // 10 in decimal
        let binary2 = 0b0011; // 3 in decimal

        let result = binary1 + binary2; // 10 + 3 = 13 in decimal
        console.log(result); // Output: 13


Summary:
        Prefix binary literals with 0b.
        Use parseInt() to convert binary strings to decimal numbers.
        Use toString(2) to convert decimal numbers to binary.
