🛣️ 1. What is req.url?

    👉 req.url represents the complete URL path that the client requested.
    It includes query parameters too.

    Example:
   
        app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
        console.log(req.url);
        res.send("Users Page");
        });

    ✅ If you visit this URL:

        http://localhost:3000/users?name=John

    Output will be:

        /users?name=John

    🔑 Key Points:

        It shows the full URL path (with query parameters 🔍 included).
        It represents what the client actually typed in the browser.


🚏 2. What is req.route.path?

    👉 req.route.path represents the original route definition in Express.
    It does NOT show query parameters or dynamic parts.

    Example:
  
        app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
        console.log(req.route.path);
        res.send("User Detail");
        });

    ✅ If you visit:

        http://localhost:3000/users/123?name=John

    Output will be:

        /users/:id

    🔑 Key Points:
        
        Shows the route pattern you defined (with dynamic placeholders like :id 🔑).
        It does not include query strings or actual parameter values.
