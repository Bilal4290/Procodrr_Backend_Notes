🌟 Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) in Node.js

    🔹 What is Event-Driven Architecture?
    
        Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design pattern where program execution is triggered by events rather than a predefined sequence of commands. Every task happens after an event occurs (like a button click, file read, or message received).

    📌 Key Idea: Instead of running code line by line, the system waits for events and executes corresponding actions when they occur.


⚡ Three Key Components of EDA:

    1️⃣ Event Emitter 🛎 (Source of Events):

        The Event Emitter is responsible for generating events in the system. It could be:

        A user clicking a button 🖱
        A file being read 📂
        A message received in a chat app 💬

        Example in Node.js:

            const EventEmitter = require("events");
            const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

            // Emitting an event
            eventEmitter.emit("userLoggedIn", "John Doe");

        📌 Here, "userLoggedIn" is the event being emitted.


    2️⃣ Event Listener 👂 (Listener for Events):

        The Event Listener waits for specific events and triggers an action when the event is emitted.

        Example in Node.js:

            eventEmitter.on("userLoggedIn", (userName) => {
                    console.log(`User logged in: ${userName}`);
            });

        📌 Here, whenever "userLoggedIn" is emitted, the listener catches it and executes a function.


    3️⃣ Event Handler 🎯 (Performs an Action):

        The Event Handler is the function that runs when an event is triggered. It contains the logic that should execute when an event occurs.

        🔹 Example (Complete Code in Node.js)

            const EventEmitter = require("events");
            const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

            // Event Listener & Handler
            eventEmitter.on("userLoggedIn", (userName) => {
            console.log(`Welcome ${userName}, you have successfully logged in!`);
            });

            // Emitting the Event
            eventEmitter.emit("userLoggedIn", "John Doe");

            📌 Output:

                Welcome John Doe, you have successfully logged in!

        🔥 This is the foundation of EDA! Whenever the "userLoggedIn" event occurs, the listener catches it and executes the handler.



📊 Visualizing Event-Driven Architecture:


        User Action 🖱 (Click/Login)  --->  Event Emitter 🛎  
                                            |
                                            v
                                Event Listener 👂 (Waits for Event)
                                            |
                                            v
                                Event Handler 🎯 (Executes Task)



🖥 Event-Driven Architecture in Browsers:

    Browsers also use Event Listeners based on EDA.

    🔹 Example in Browser (JavaScript DOM Events)

            document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
                    alert("Button Clicked!");
            });

        📌 Here:

            ✔ "click" is the event.
            ✔ The Event Listener waits for a user to click.
            ✔ The Event Handler (function) runs and shows an alert.


🌍 Real-World Examples of EDA Pattern:
        
    Use Case                            🛠	How Event-Driven Architecture Works?
    1️⃣ Node.js 🟢	                    Uses EventEmitter to handle events in file systems, HTTP requests, and streams.
    2️⃣ Browser DOM Events 🌐	         User interactions (click, scroll, keypress) trigger event listeners.
    3️⃣ Chat Apps 💬	                Messages are received and processed as events, enabling real-time messaging.
    4️⃣ OS Handling User Inputs 🖱	    Every keyboard press, mouse movement, and system notification is event-driven.
    5️⃣ YouTube Notifications 🔔	    New video uploads trigger push notifications to subscribers.
    6️⃣ Payment Processing 💳	        A payment success triggers confirmation emails and database updates.
    7️⃣ Automation Services ⚙️	        CI/CD pipelines trigger builds after code is pushed to GitHub.


🚀 Why Use Event-Driven Architecture?

    ✅ Efficient & Scalable – Handles multiple requests asynchronously.
    ✅ Better Performance – No blocking, just event handling.
    ✅ Responsive Applications – Ideal for real-time apps like chat, stock markets, and notifications.
    ✅ Decoupled Code – Different components communicate via events, reducing dependencies.


🔥 Final Thoughts:

    EDA is at the heart of Node.js and modern web applications. It enables real-time updates, high performance, and better user experiences.
