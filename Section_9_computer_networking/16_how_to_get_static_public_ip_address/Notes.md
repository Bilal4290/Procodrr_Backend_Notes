üìå How to Get a Static Public IP Address from Your ISP:

    If you want a static public IP address, you need to contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and request one. Here‚Äôs how:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact Your ISP:

        Call or visit your ISP's website and ask if they offer static IPs.
        Some ISPs provide static IPs for free, while others charge extra (monthly fee).
        If you're using CG-NAT (Carrier-Grade NAT), you'll need to ask to opt out or get a dedicated public IP.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Your Current Public IP:

        Before requesting a static IP, check if you already have a dynamic public IP:

        Go to: What is My IP?
        Restart your router:
        If your public IP changes, you have a dynamic IP.
        If your public IP stays the same, you might already have a static IP.

    3Ô∏è‚É£ Request a Static IP Plan:

        Your ISP will typically offer two types of static IPs:

        Residential Static IP: For home users (good for gaming, remote access, and small servers).
        Business Static IP: For companies (better speeds, lower latency, and multiple IPs).
        üí∞ Cost varies:

        Some ISPs offer static IPs for free.
        Others charge $5 to $20 per month.

    4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Router:

    Once your ISP assigns you a static public IP, you need to configure it in your router:

    Log in to your router's admin panel (192.168.1.1).
    Go to WAN/Internet Settings.
    Select Static IP Configuration instead of DHCP.
    Enter the static IP, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS (provided by your ISP).
    Save settings and restart your router.

    5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Your Static IP:

    After setup:

    Go to What is My IP? again.
    Restart your router.
    If your IP doesn‚Äôt change, then you have a static public IP.
    Why Do You Need a Static Public IP?
    ‚úÖ Hosting a Server (Web, FTP, Game Servers)
    ‚úÖ Remote Access to Home Network (VPN, CCTV, IoT devices)
    ‚úÖ Better Stability for VoIP & Online Services
    ‚úÖ Avoid CG-NAT Restrictions

    Drawbacks of a Static Public IP:
    
    ‚ùå Higher Cost (Monthly charges from ISP)
    ‚ùå Security Risks (Exposed to hacking if not protected)
    ‚ùå Easier to Track (Your location & activity can be traced more easily)

    üîπ Solution? Always use a firewall and VPN for protection!

    Alternative to a Static Public IP?
    üîπ Use a Dynamic DNS (DDNS): If your ISP doesn‚Äôt offer static IPs, use No-IP or DuckDNS to get a domain name that updates automatically when your dynamic IP changes.
    üîπ Use a VPN with a Static IP: Some VPN services offer dedicated static IPs for remote access.
