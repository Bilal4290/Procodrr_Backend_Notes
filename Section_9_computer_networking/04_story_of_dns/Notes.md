📜 The Story of DNS, IP Addresses & Hosts.txt (Year-wise Timeline) 🌐

    Before DNS existed, computers used IP addresses to communicate. However, remembering long numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) was difficult. This led to the creation of Hosts.txt and later the Domain Name System (DNS).


    🔹 Step 1: Early Internet & The Need for IP Addresses (1969-1970s)
    📡 1969: ARPANET (First Internet) was created to connect computers at UCLA, Stanford, UCSB, and the University of Utah.
    💻 Computers communicated using IP addresses (e.g., 172.16.254.1).
    📌 Problem: Users had to manually remember and type long numerical IP addresses.


    🔹 Step 2: The Role of Elizabeth Feinler & Hosts.txt (1970s-1983) 📝
    👩‍💻 Who was Elizabeth Feinler?
    ✅ She was a computer scientist at Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
    ✅ She managed the Network Information Center (NIC), which kept track of all internet-connected computers.

    📁 How did Hosts.txt Work?
    1️⃣ Every time a new computer joined the network, Elizabeth Feinler manually added its IP address to hosts.txt.
    2️⃣ This file was then shared with all other computers, so they could find each other.
    3️⃣ 📞 Users had to call Stanford University to request an IP address entry!

    🔹 Problem: As more people connected to the internet, managing this file became slow and inefficient.


     🔹 Step 3: Introduction of .com, .gov, .org (1983) 📛
    👩‍💻 Elizabeth Feinler's Contribution
    ✅ To organize IP addresses better, she introduced domain name extensions:

        .com → Commercial organizations (e.g., Ford.com 🚗)
        .gov → Government agencies (e.g., NASA.gov 🚀)
        .org → Non-profits (e.g., Wikipedia.org 📚)
    📌 This system helped users easily find organizations based on their category.


    🔹 Step 4: The Birth of the Domain Name System (DNS) (1983) 🌍
    📡 1983: Paul Mockapetris, a computer scientist, realized Hosts.txt was not scalable.
    📌 Solution: He created the Domain Name System (DNS), which automated the process.

    🔹 How DNS Works?
    1️⃣ Users type Ford.com instead of its IP address.
    2️⃣ The request goes to a DNS server, which returns the IP address.
    3️⃣ The computer connects automatically using the retrieved IP.

    📌 This eliminated the need for manually updating hosts.txt. 🎉


    🔹 Step 5: DNS + Telnet Integration (Mid-1980s)
    📌 Before DNS:

    Users had to first get the IP from hosts.txt or DNS manually.

    Then, they opened a terminal and typed:

            telnet 172.16.254.1

    📌 After DNS Integration:
       Users could directly type the domain name in Telnet

            telnet ford.com

    Telnet automatically contacted DNS behind the scenes to resolve the IP address.
    🚀 This made connecting to remote computers easier & faster!



    📅 Final Timeline of DNS Evolution
    Year	Event
    1969	🌐 ARPANET (First Internet) created. Computers use IP addresses.
    1970s	📜 Hosts.txt file manually managed by Elizabeth Feinler at Stanford.
    1983	📛 Feinler introduced .com, .gov, .org to categorize domains.
    1983	🌍 Paul Mockapetris invented DNS, replacing Hosts.txt.
    1985	🖥️ Telnet was modified to use domain names instead of IPs.



    📌 Summary: Who Created What?

    Technology                                  	Creator	                                Year
    📡 Hosts.txt File	                            Elizabeth Feinler	                    1970s
    🌐 Domain Extensions (.com, .gov, .org)	         Elizabeth Feinler	                     1983
    🔍 Domain Name System (DNS)	                    Paul Mockapetris	                    1983
    🖥️ Telnet using Domain Names	                 Integrated into UNIX Systems	         1985

    📌 Without Elizabeth Feinler, we wouldn’t have .com, .org, .gov.
    📌 Without Paul Mockapetris, we’d still be manually updating hosts.txt!



    🚀 The Impact of DNS Today

    🔹 Websites load instantly without typing IP addresses.
    🔹 Millions of domain names are registered globally.
    🔹 Search engines and online businesses depend on DNS.
