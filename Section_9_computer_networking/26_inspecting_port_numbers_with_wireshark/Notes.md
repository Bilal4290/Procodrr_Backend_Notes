üîπ Inspecting Port Numbers with Wireshark:

    Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that allows you to capture and inspect network traffic, including port numbers used in communication between devices.

    üîπ Steps to Inspect Port Numbers in Wireshark:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Install and Open Wireshark:

        Download and install Wireshark from Wireshark's official website.
        Open Wireshark and select your active network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

    2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Capturing Traffic:

        Click the Start Capture button (blue shark fin ü¶à).
        Perform an action like:
        Open a website (e.g., https://google.com).
        Ping a server (ping google.com).
        SSH into a remote server (ssh user@server.com).

    3Ô∏è‚É£ Filter by Port Number:

        Once packets appear, use display filters to see traffic on specific ports:
        HTTP (Port 80) ‚Üí tcp.port == 80
        HTTPS (Port 443) ‚Üí tcp.port == 443
        DNS (Port 53) ‚Üí udp.port == 53
        SSH (Port 22) ‚Üí tcp.port == 22

    4Ô∏è‚É£ Inspect a Packet:

        Click on a captured packet.
        Expand the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) section.
        Look for:
        Source Port (Where the request is coming from)
        Destination Port (Where the request is going)

    5Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Port Behavior:

        Client requests use random high-numbered ports (e.g., 50000+).
        Server responses use well-known ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
        Some services use custom ports (e.g., game servers, database connections).
        üîπ Example: Analyzing HTTPS Traffic
        1Ô∏è‚É£ You visit https://google.com.
        2Ô∏è‚É£ Your browser sends a request from random port (e.g., 52000) to Google‚Äôs port 443 (HTTPS).
        3Ô∏è‚É£ Wireshark shows:

            Source IP: 192.168.1.10
            Source Port: 52000
            Destination IP: 142.250.180.14
            Destination Port: 443

        4Ô∏è‚É£ The server responds back to port 52000, completing the connection.

    üîπ Summary:

        ‚úÖ Wireshark helps inspect how port numbers direct network traffic.
        ‚úÖ Filtering by port number allows you to analyze specific services.
        ‚úÖ Observing source and destination ports helps understand client-server communication.
