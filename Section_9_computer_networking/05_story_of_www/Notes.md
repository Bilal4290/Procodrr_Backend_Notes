🌍 The Story of the World Wide Web (WWW) & Web Technologies

    🔹 Step 1: The Problem Before the Web (Before 1989)
    Before the web, if you wanted more details about a particular word or topic, you had to:
    📚 Read books or documents manually.
    ☎️ Call experts or organizations for information.
    📂 Use early computer systems, but they lacked easy navigation between documents.

    Scientists at CERN (Switzerland) needed a way to easily share and connect research papers.



    🔹 Step 2: Tim Berners-Lee Invents the World Wide Web (1989-1991)
    👨‍💻 Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN, decided to solve this problem.

    📌 His Idea:
    🔗 Users should be able to click on a word (hyperlink) and automatically navigate to another page.

    🌐 His Inventions:
    1️⃣ HTML (HyperText Markup Language) → To create structured web pages.
    2️⃣ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) → To send web pages over the internet.
    3️⃣ First Web Browser → "WorldWideWeb" (Later renamed Nexus).
    4️⃣ First Web Server → To store and serve webpages.

    📅 1991: He launched the first-ever website:
    🔗 http://info.cern.ch

    📝 Before 1991, the Internet was only accessible to organizations, NOT the public!



    🔹 Step 3: The First Web Browser & Public Access to the Web (1993-1995)
    📌 The Web Became Public → Before this, the internet was only used by government & universities.

    🔹 Marc Andreessen developed Mosaic (1993), the first browser with images & a user-friendly interface.
    🔹 Mosaic → Netscape Navigator (1994), which dominated the early internet era.
    🔹 By 1995, multiple browsers appeared, including Internet Explorer.

    🔹 Problem: Early websites were only text-based (HTML-only, no colors or styles).


    🔹 Step 4: CSS & JavaScript Are Created (1995-1996)
    📌 Why? To make websites more interactive and beautiful.

    🎨 1996 - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Introduced
    👨‍💻 Creator: Håkon Wium Lie (while working with Tim Berners-Lee).
    💡 Purpose: Adds styles (colors, fonts, layouts) to websites.

    ⚡ 1995 - JavaScript Created
    👨‍💻 Creator: Brendan Eich (at Netscape).
    💡 Purpose: Adds interactivity (buttons, animations, dynamic content).



    🔹 Step 5: HTTP Protocol & Its Evolution
    📌 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) was created by Tim Berners-Lee (1991) to transfer web pages.
    📌 It was built on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), ensuring reliable data transmission.

    🔹 What is TCP?
    👨‍💻 Creators: Vinton Cerf & Robert Kahn (1974).
    💡 Purpose: Breaks data into packets and ensures correct delivery.

    🔹 First HTTP Version (1991) → Only supported GET requests (to retrieve data).
    🔹 Later Versions (1996 onwards) added POST, PUT, DELETE methods for dynamic websites.

🌍 How the Web Works - A Simple Flow:

    1️⃣ User opens a browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
    2️⃣ User types a website URL (e.g., www.google.com).
    3️⃣ Browser contacts the **DNS server** to get the website’s IP address.
    4️⃣ Browser sends an **HTTP request** to the web server.
    5️⃣ Web server processes the request and sends back an **HTML page**.
    6️⃣ Browser renders the page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
    7️⃣ User sees the website on the screen.

🌍 The Complete History of Information Transfer, the Internet, DNS & the World Wide Web

    🔹 Step 1: How Information Transfer Began 
    1️⃣ Early Human Communication (Before Technology)
    📜 Before writing (Prehistoric Times): Information was shared by speaking & storytelling.
    ✉️ Writing & Letters (Ancient Times): People sent messages using letters (physical matter), which were slow.
    🏇 Messengers & Postal Services (500 BCE - 1800s): Information was carried by humans, horses, and pigeons.

    🔹 Step 2: The Invention of Telecommunication
    2️⃣ The First Revolution: Telephone (1876)
    📞 Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876.
    💡 Concept: Sound waves (energy) were converted into electrical signals, transferred through wires, and then converted back into sound.
    🏢 Company Founded: AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph)

    🔹 Problem: Only sound could be transferred, no text or documents.

    🔹 Step 3: The Birth of Computers & Early Data Transfer
    3️⃣ The First Computer (1940s-1950s)
    🖥️ The first programmable computer, ENIAC, was built in 1945.
    📂 Instead of storing data on paper, computers stored it as electrical signals (binary code: 0s & 1s).

    🔹 Problem: How do we transfer this stored data from one computer to another?

    🔹 Step 4: The Internet is Born (1960s-1980s)
    4️⃣ Cold War & The Need for a Computer Network (1957)
    🚀 1957 - Russia (USSR) launched the first satellite, Sputnik-1.
    🇺🇸 The USA feared they were falling behind in technology.
    🏢 1958 - USA created DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) to advance technology.

    5️⃣ ARPANET - The First Internet (1969)
    🌍 DARPA created ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in 1969 to connect computers.
    🎓 The first four universities to be connected:

    UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles)
    UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara)
    Stanford University
    University of Utah
    📡 First message sent on ARPANET (October 29, 1969):
    They tried to send "LOGIN", but only "LO" was received before the system crashed. 😂
    💡 Fun Fact: The first successful message was "LOL" unintentionally!

    🔹 Problem: Different organizations started creating their own private networks, but they couldn’t communicate because they used different protocols.

    6️⃣ TCP/IP - The Universal Internet Language (1974-1983)
    👨‍💻 Vinton Cerf & Robert Kahn developed TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) in 1974.
    📅 January 1, 1983 - ARPANET officially switched to TCP/IP, forming the foundation of the modern internet.

    🔹 Step 5: The Birth of DNS (1983-1985)
    7️⃣ Hosts.txt & Elizabeth Feinler (1983)
    📄 Problem:
    Initially, every computer connecting to the internet had to be listed in a hosts.txt file, managed manually by Elizabeth Feinler at Stanford University.

    📞 As the internet grew, people had to call her to add their IP address manually!
    🔹 Solution: The Domain Name System (DNS) was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris to automate this process.
    💡 Now, instead of remembering IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.78), people could use domain names (e.g., google.com).

    🔹 Step 6: The Birth of the World Wide Web (WWW) (1989-1991)
    8️⃣ Tim Berners-Lee Invents the Web (1989-1991)
    👨‍💻 Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN (Switzerland), needed a way to easily access and link research papers.
    💡 His idea: Users should be able to click on a word (hyperlink) and automatically navigate to another page.

    🎉 He created:
    1️⃣ HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - To structure web pages.
    2️⃣ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) - To send web pages over the internet.
    3️⃣ First Web Browser - "WorldWideWeb" (later renamed Nexus).
    4️⃣ First Web Server - Hosted the first website.

    📅 1991: He launched the first-ever website:
    🔗 http://info.cern.ch

    🔹 Problem: At this point, the web was only text-based (no colors, no images, no interactivity).

    🔹 Step 7: The Web Becomes Public (1993-1996)
    9️⃣ First Web Browser for the Public - Mosaic (1993)
    👨‍💻 Marc Andreessen created Mosaic in 1993, the first browser with images & a user-friendly interface.
    🔥 Netscape Navigator (1994) followed and dominated the early web.

    🔟 CSS & JavaScript Are Created (1995-1996)
    🎨 CSS (1996) - Created by Håkon Wium Lie to add styles (colors, fonts, layouts).
    ⚡ JavaScript (1995) - Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape to make websites interactive.

    📌 1996+ - The modern web started evolving with multimedia, animations, and better user experiences.
