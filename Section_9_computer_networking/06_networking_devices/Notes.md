📡 Important Networking Devices & Terminologies

    1️⃣ Host 🖥️
    📌 Definition:
    A host is any device in a network that produces or consumes data.

    📍 Examples of Hosts:

    Computers 💻 (Desktops, Laptops)
    Mobile Phones 📱
    Smart TVs 📺
    Printers 🖨️
    IoT Devices (Smart Home, Smart Watches) 🏠⌚
    📌 Key Point:
    A host is a device that sends or receives data but is NOT responsible for forwarding it to other devices.


    2️⃣ Repeater 📶
    📌 Definition:
    A repeater is a device used to boost weak signals in a network to prevent data loss over long distances.

    📍 Where are Repeaters Used?
    ✔️ Between Cities 🏙️ →🏙️ (To strengthen long-distance signals)
    ✔️ From ISPs to Homes 🌍 → 🏠 (Used by Internet providers)
    ✔️ Inside Buildings 🏢 (To boost Wi-Fi signals)

    📌 Key Point:
    A repeater does not change data, it only amplifies the signal so it can travel further.


    3️⃣ Hub 🏢
    📌 Definition:
    A hub is a special type of repeater that is connected to multiple computers in a network.

    📍 How It Works?
    🔹 A hub receives data from one computer and forwards it to all connected computers, whether they need the data or not.

    📍 Why is a Hub Inefficient?
    🚫 Bandwidth Waste: Sends data to all devices, even if they don’t need it.
    🚫 Collisions: If two computers send data at the same time, it can collide.

    📌 Key Point:
    Hubs were used in older networks, but they are rarely used today because switches are more efficient.


    4️⃣ Switch 🏗️
    📌 Definition:
    A switch is an intelligent hub that sends data only to the device that needs it.

    📍 How It Works?
    ✔️ Stores the MAC addresses of all connected devices.
    ✔️ Sends data only to the intended recipient (not to all devices like a hub).

    📌 Why is a Switch Better Than a Hub?
    ✅ No Bandwidth Waste → Data is sent only to the correct device.
    ✅ No Collisions → Improves network speed & efficiency.

    📌 Key Point:
    Switches are widely used today in both home and business networks.


    5️⃣ Router 🌍
    📌 Definition:
    A router is a device that connects multiple networks together and manages internet traffic.

    📍 Functions of a Router:
    ✔️ Connects to Wi-Fi 📡 → Provides wireless internet access.
    ✔️ Manages Traffic 🚦 → Decides which device gets how much data.
    ✔️ Has CPU, RAM & Storage 💾 → Works like a small computer.
    ✔️ Creates HTTP Server 🌐 → Some routers have a built-in web interface for settings.
    ✔️ Works Like a Switch → Can connect multiple devices via Ethernet cables.

    📌 Modern Routers:
    ✅ Include a built-in modem (so you don’t need a separate modem).
    ✅ Provide both wired & wireless internet (Wi-Fi + Ethernet).

    📌 Key Point:
    A router is one of the most important devices in networking because it controls internet traffic in homes, offices, and data centers.


    6️⃣ Bridge 🌉
    📌 Definition:
    A bridge is a device used to connect two different networks together.

    📍 Example:
    🛜 If you have two routers in different buildings, you can connect them using a bridge.

    📌 Do We Still Use Bridges?
    ❌ Not much anymore. Modern routers can connect to each other without a bridge.

    📌 Key Point:
    Bridges were used in older networks but are rarely used today because routers handle these tasks.


    7️⃣ Modem 📞 (Modulator-Demodulator)
    📌 Definition:
    A modem converts digital signals to analog signals and vice versa so data can be transmitted over different mediums.

    📍 Why is this Needed?
    ✔️ Computers use digital signals (0s & 1s).
    ✔️ Telephone/Fiber cables use analog/light signals.
    ✔️ A modem converts between these signals.

    📍 Types of Modems:
    🔹 DSL Modem → Works with phone lines.
    🔹 Cable Modem → Works with coaxial cables.
    🔹 Fiber Modem (ONT) → Works with fiber-optic cables.

    📌 Key Point:
    Modems are often built into modern routers (so you don’t need a separate one).


    8️⃣ ONT Modem (Optical Network Terminal) 🔦
    📌 Definition:
    An ONT modem is a special modem used for fiber-optic internet.

    📍 How It Works?
    ✔️ Fiber-optic cables carry data as light signals.
    ✔️ ONT converts light signals → electrical signals.
    ✔️ Ethernet cables (copper wires) carry electrical signals.

    📌 Key Point:
    ONT modems are essential for fiber-optic internet connections.



    9️⃣ Access Point 📶
    📌 Definition:
    An Access Point (AP) is a device that extends the range of a Wi-Fi network.

    📍 How It Works?
    ✔️ A wired connection runs from the router to the access point.
    ✔️ The AP creates a new Wi-Fi zone, improving coverage.

    📍 Where Are Access Points Used?
    ✔️ Large Homes 🏠
    ✔️ Hotels 🏨
    ✔️ Offices & Malls 🏢

    📌 Key Point:
    An Access Point boosts Wi-Fi signals but is wired to the main router.


    🔟 Node 📍
    📌 Definition:
    A node is any device in a network that processes or forwards data.

    📍 Examples of Nodes:
    ✔️ Routers
    ✔️ Switches
    ✔️ Modems

    📌 Difference Between Host & Node
    ✔️ All hosts are nodes, but not all nodes are hosts.
    ✔️ Example: A router is a node but not a host because it doesn’t consume or produce data.

    📌 Key Point:
    Nodes help in data transfer, but hosts consume or produce data.



    1️⃣1️⃣ Mobile Hotspot as a Router 📲
    📌 Can a mobile phone work as a router?
    ✅ Yes!
    ✔️ When you turn on hotspot, your phone acts as a router by forwarding data to connected devices.
    ✔️ Your phone has a CPU, RAM, storage, and networking functions like a router.

    📌 Key Point:
    Your mobile phone can act as a router when using a hotspot.
