🌍 How Your Home Router Connects to the Internet (Complete Flow)

    Let's go step by step, so you fully understand how your home router connects to the internet. 
    
    📌 Step 1: Your Router Gets Power and an IP 
    When you power on your router, it already has a default private IP address (like 192.168.1.1).
    This IP address is used to manage the router settings and assign IPs to devices in your home network.


    📌 Step 2: Your Router Gets an Internet Connection
    There are two ways a router can get internet access:
    1️⃣ Through an Ethernet cable (common in offices and some homes).
    2️⃣ Through an Optical Fiber Cable (common in modern internet setups, including your home).

    📌 In your home setup, an optical fiber cable is coming instead of an Ethernet cable. Let's understand why.



    🌐 How Your Home Router Connects to the Internet (Fiber Connection)
    Your home router is a child router, meaning it is connected to a main router (controlled by your Internet Service Provider, ISP).

    🔹 What Happens When an Optical Fiber Cable Reaches Your Home?
    1️⃣ Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) runs an optical fiber cable to your home.
    2️⃣ This fiber cable does NOT plug directly into your router because routers don’t process light signals.
    3️⃣ Instead, the fiber cable connects to an ONT (Optical Network Terminal) modem.
    4️⃣ The ONT modem converts fiber-optic light signals into electrical signals.
    5️⃣ Then, an Ethernet cable runs from the ONT modem to your home router’s WAN port.
    6️⃣ The home router receives an IP address from the ISP’s main router and provides internet access to your devices.

    📌 Key Concept:

    Optical fiber cables use light signals, which are fast but need an ONT modem to convert them into electrical signals for your router.
    Ethernet cables carry electrical signals and can be directly plugged into a router.



    🌍 How Your ISP is Connected to the Global Internet (Main Router & Ocean Cables)
    Your ISP’s main router is part of a bigger network, which connects to the worldwide internet.

    1️⃣ Your ISP’s main router is connected to multiple fiber optic backbone networks.
    2️⃣ These fiber networks extend across cities, countries, and even continents using submarine (ocean) cables.
    3️⃣ These submarine cables connect ISPs worldwide, forming the global internet.
    4️⃣ Your home router gets an IP address from the ISP, which allows you to access the internet.

    📌 Key Takeaway:

    Your home router is a small part of a massive internet system.
    Optical fiber cables → ISP’s main router → Ocean cables → Global Internet.



    📌 How Main & Child Routers Communicate
    Now, let’s understand how a child router (your home router) and a main router (ISP’s router) communicate.

    🔹 When Your Router is Connected to ISP's Router (With DHCP ON)

    Your home router (child router) has its own private network (192.168.x.x).
    The child router assigns IP addresses to all devices in your home (using DHCP).
    Your home router gets an IP address from the ISP’s main router (usually a public or private IP).
    Your home router and its devices cannot be directly accessed by the main router’s network because of NAT (Network Address Translation).
    🔹 If You Turn OFF DHCP on Your Child Router

    Your home router stops assigning IP addresses.
    Instead, the main router (ISP’s router) assigns IP addresses directly to your home devices.
    Now, all devices in your home become part of the ISP’s network, and the main router can access them.

    📌 Why Would You Turn Off DHCP?
    ✅ To merge networks (so that the main router can directly communicate with your home devices).
    ✅ To avoid double NAT, which can cause connectivity issues in gaming, VoIP, etc.


    📌 Final Flow of Internet Connection
    Let’s put everything together in a simple step-by-step flow:

    1️⃣ The global internet is connected by fiber optic ocean cables.
    2️⃣ ISPs have main routers that connect to these global internet cables.
    3️⃣ Your home receives an optical fiber cable from the ISP.
    4️⃣ An ONT modem converts fiber signals into electrical signals.
    5️⃣ The ONT modem sends an Ethernet cable to your home router’s WAN port.
    6️⃣ Your home router assigns private IP addresses to all your devices.
    7️⃣ Your home router gets an IP address from the ISP’s main router, allowing you to access the internet.


    📌 Summary & Key Takeaways
    ✔️ A router provides IP addresses to LAN-connected devices, even if it's offline.
    ✔️ Your home router is a child router; it connects to the ISP’s main router.
    ✔️ Optical fiber cables use light signals and need an ONT modem to convert them into electrical signals.
    ✔️ ISP routers connect to global internet cables using fiber-optic networks and ocean cables.
    ✔️ Turning off DHCP on your home router makes it part of the ISP’s main network.
    ✔️ Your home network is a small part of a much larger internet system!



    📌 Is the DHCP Server ON or OFF by Default in a Home Router (Child Router)?
    ✅ By default, the DHCP server is ON in your home (child) router.

    This means your child router assigns IP addresses to all devices connected to it (like your phone, laptop, or smart TV).
    ✅ Your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) main router does NOT assign IPs to your home devices by default.

    Instead, your child router creates its own local network (LAN) and distributes IPs to your devices.
    The main router only assigns an IP address to your child router (usually a public or private WAN IP).



    📌 How Your Child Router Assigns IP Addresses in Your Home
    1️⃣ Your child router has a built-in DHCP server.
    2️⃣ When a device (e.g., a laptop or phone) connects to your router, it asks for an IP address.
    3️⃣ Your child router's DHCP server assigns a private IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).
    4️⃣ This device can now communicate with other devices in your home network and access the internet.



    📌 What If You Turn Off the DHCP Server in Your Child Router?
    If you disable the DHCP server in your home router:
    1️⃣ Your child router will no longer assign IP addresses to your devices.
    2️⃣ Your ISP’s main router will now assign IP addresses to all devices in your home.
    3️⃣ All devices will be part of the ISP’s main network instead of a separate home network.

    ✅ This setup is useful if you want your home network to be directly managed by your ISP's router.
    ❌ But it is not necessary for most home users because it removes local network control.
