🌐 How the Internet Reaches Our Home?

    The internet is a massive global network that connects billions of devices. But how does it actually reach our home? Let's break it down step by step, along with a diagram for better understanding.


    📶 Step-by-Step Flow of Internet to Our Home
    1️⃣ Undersea Optical Fiber Cables (Internet Backbone)
    The internet starts with huge undersea optical fiber cables that connect continents.
    These cables carry data at high speeds (terabits per second).
    Companies like Google, Facebook, and telecom providers own these cables.
    2️⃣ Internet Service Provider (ISP)
    The undersea cables connect to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in different countries.
    ISPs build data centers and main routers that distribute internet to cities.
    3️⃣ Main ISP Network (WAN – Wide Area Network)
    ISPs send the internet to local cities using fiber optic cables, satellite, or microwave towers.
    The main ISP router manages internet access for multiple areas.
    4️⃣ Local ISP Network (MAN – Metropolitan Area Network)
    In a city or town, internet is distributed using fiber cables to local ISP offices.
    The local ISP acts as a bridge between the main ISP and home users.
    5️⃣ Fiber Optic Cables to Your Home (FTTH – Fiber to the Home)
    ISPs use fiber optic cables to bring internet to homes & offices.
    These cables are connected to ONT Modems (Optical Network Terminal).
    6️⃣ ONT Modem & Router in Your Home
    The ONT Modem converts fiber optic light signals into electrical signals.
    From the ONT, an Ethernet cable connects to a router.
    The router assigns IP addresses & provides WiFi for multiple devices.

       🛠️ Key Network Components in Your Home
        ✅ ONT Modem: Converts fiber optic signals to electrical signals.
        ✅ Router: Creates WiFi & assigns local IP addresses.
        ✅ Ethernet Cable: Connects ONT to Router.
        ✅ Devices (Phone, Laptop, TV): Connect via WiFi or LAN.

        🔹 Summary
        The internet starts with undersea cables 🏝️.
        It reaches main ISP data centers 🏢.
        It is distributed in cities via fiber optic cables.
        Local ISPs bring it to homes via FTTH (Fiber to the Home).
        An ONT modem & router provide WiFi & LAN in your home 🏠.
