🌐 What is a Network?

    A network is a group of two or more connected devices (computers, phones, servers, etc.) that communicate and share data.

    📌 Key Points:
    ✅ A network requires at least two devices to exist.
    ✅ Data is transferred using wired (Ethernet, Fiber) or wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) connections.
    ✅ Networks enable communication, resource sharing, and data transfer.


🔗 What is Networking?

    Networking is the study and process of how data is transferred between devices in a network. It includes:

    ✅ Understanding Data Transmission – How data moves from one device to another.
    ✅ Network Protocols – Rules for communication (e.g., HTTP, TCP/IP, FTP).
    ✅ Network Security – Protecting data from unauthorized access.
    ✅ Troubleshooting Network Issues – Diagnosing slow speeds, disconnections, etc.

    📌 In Simple Terms:
    👉 Networking = The science of designing, building, and managing networks.



💡 How Does Data Transfer in a Network?

    1️⃣ Device A sends data (e.g., a request to load a website).
    2️⃣ Data is broken into packets (small pieces of information).
    3️⃣ Packets travel through the network (via routers, switches, cables, or wireless signals).
    4️⃣ Device B receives & reassembles the data (e.g., the webpage loads).
