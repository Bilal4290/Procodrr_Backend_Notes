🌐 Types of Networks (LAN, MAN, WAN, etc.)

    A network is a group of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources. There are different types of networks based on their size, coverage area, and purpose.

    Let’s explore them one by one with detailed explanations. 🚀

    1️⃣ LAN (Local Area Network) 🏠

        📌 Definition:

            A LAN is a network that covers a small geographical area, such as a home, office, school, or building.

        📍 Characteristics:

            ✔️ Limited Coverage → Covers a small area (up to a few kilometers).
            ✔️ High Speed → Speeds range from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps.
            ✔️ Privately Owned → Managed by an individual or organization.
            ✔️ Uses Ethernet/Wi-Fi → Devices are connected using wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi) connections.

        📍 Examples of LAN:

            🏡 Home Network → Your Wi-Fi router connects multiple devices in your home.
            🏢 Office Network → Employees in an office use a shared LAN for communication and file sharing.
            🏫 School Network → All computers in a school lab are connected to a LAN.

        📌 Key Devices Used in LAN:

            🔹 Router (Connects LAN to the Internet)
            🔹 Switch (Connects multiple devices within LAN)
            🔹 Access Point (Extends Wi-Fi coverage in LAN)

        📌 Key Point:

             A LAN is fast, private, and used for short distances.


    2️⃣ MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) 🏙️

        📌 Definition:

            A MAN is a network that covers a city or metropolitan area. It is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

        📍 Characteristics:

            ✔️ Covers a City → Typically spans 10 to 100 km.
            ✔️ High-Speed Fiber Optic Connections → Uses fiber-optic cables for fast data transfer.
            ✔️ Owned by Government or ISPs → Managed by telecom companies or city administrations.
            ✔️ Interconnects Multiple LANs → A MAN connects different LANs in a city.

        📍 Examples of MAN:

            🏙️ City-Wide Wi-Fi → Public Wi-Fi provided by the government in a city.
            🏥 Hospital Network → A hospital network interconnecting multiple buildings across a city.
            🏫 University Campus Network → A network connecting all departments of a university in a city.

        📌 Key Point:

            A MAN connects multiple LANs across a city using high-speed fiber-optic links.


    3️⃣ WAN (Wide Area Network) 🌍

        📌 Definition:

            A WAN is a network that covers a large geographical area such as a country or continent.

        📍 Characteristics:

            ✔️ Covers Long Distances → Can span hundreds or thousands of kilometers.
            ✔️ Uses Public & Private Networks → Uses fiber optics, satellite links, and leased telecom lines.
            ✔️ Owned by ISPs → Managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like AT&T, Verizon, or Airtel.
            ✔️ Lower Speed Than LAN → Due to long-distance communication.

        📍 Examples of WAN:

            🌍 Internet → The largest WAN that connects all networks worldwide.
            🏦 Banking Networks → Banks use WAN to connect ATMs and branches across the world.
            🏢 Multinational Corporations → A company with offices in different countries uses WAN for communication.

        📌 Key Point:

            A WAN is a large-scale network that connects different LANs & MANs across long distances.

    4️⃣ Internet 🌎 (A WAN Example)

        📌 Definition:

            The Internet is the largest WAN that connects billions of devices worldwide.

        📌 Why is the Internet a WAN?

            ✔️ Covers the entire world → The Internet spans across countries and continents.
            ✔️ Uses multiple technologies → Uses fiber-optic cables, satellites, and wireless networks.
            ✔️ Managed by multiple ISPs → No single owner; different companies manage different parts.

        📌 Key Point:

            The Internet is an example of a WAN because it connects different networks worldwide.


    5️⃣ CAN (Campus Area Network) 🏫

        📌 Definition:

            A CAN is a network that connects multiple LANs within a university or corporate campus.

        📍 Examples of CAN:

            🏢 Company Headquarters Network → A large company’s offices in a city.
            🏫 University Network → Interconnects different departments and labs.

        📌 Key Point:

            A CAN is larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN and is limited to a single organization.


    6️⃣ PAN (Personal Area Network) 📱

        📌 Definition:

            A PAN is a small network for personal devices within a few meters.

        📍 Examples of PAN:
