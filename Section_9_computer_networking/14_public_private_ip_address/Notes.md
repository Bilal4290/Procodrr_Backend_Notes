üìå Why Do ipconfig and "What is My IP" Show Different IPs?

    When you run ipconfig (on Windows) or ifconfig (on Linux/macOS), you get your local/private IP address.
    When you visit "What is my IP" on a website, you see your public IP address.

    Command	            Returns	                                Scope
    ipconfig	        Private IP (e.g., 192.168.1.2)	        Inside your home network (LAN)
    What is my IP?	    Public IP (e.g., 39.50.220.14)	        Visible on the Internet


1Ô∏è‚É£ Private IP Address:

    üìç Definition: 
                    Used inside local networks (LANs). 
                    Cannot be accessed from the internet directly.
                    The concept of private IP addresses was introduced in 1996 through RFC 1918, which was published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    üìç Example: 192.168.1.10, 10.0.0.25, 172.16.5.3
    üìç Why Needed?

    IPv4 has only ~4.3 billion addresses, but more than 18.8 billions of devices exist.
    Instead of assigning every device a public IP, we use private IPs inside LANs.
    These are not routable on the internet.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Public IP Address

    üìç Definition: Unique, routable address used to identify devices on the internet.
    üìç Example: 39.50.220.14, 102.5.8.90
    üìç Why Needed?

    A website (like google.com) needs a public IP so people can reach it.
    Every device talking to the internet must use a public IP.
    Since IPv4 is limited, public IPs are now sold by ISPs.



üìå How Do Private IP Devices Access the Internet?

    Because private IPs cannot communicate directly with the internet, we use a technology called NAT (Network Address Translation).

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Before 2010: NAT
    Your router had a public IP (e.g., 39.50.220.14).
    All your home devices had private IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.20).
    When a device sent a request to a website (google.com), the router replaced the private IP with its public IP and forwarded the request.
    The website only saw the router's public IP.
    When the response came back, the router sent it back to the correct private device.


    2Ô∏è‚É£ After 2010: CG-NAT (Carrier-Grade NAT)
    ISPs ran out of public IPv4 addresses.
    Instead of assigning each home a public IP, ISPs assigned a private IP (e.g., 100.64.1.5) to home routers.
    Now, thousands of homes share a single public IP assigned to the ISP router.
    The ISP does NAT twice (first at your home router, then at their company router) before traffic reaches the internet.
    This is called Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT).

    
    üîπ Example of CG-NAT Process:

        Your device (192.168.1.10) sends a request to google.com.
        Your home router (192.168.1.1) changes it to a private IP like 100.64.1.5.
        The ISP router (100.64.1.5) changes it to a public IP like 39.50.220.14.
        The request reaches google.com.
        The response follows the reverse path.

    üîπ Why Do "What is My IP" and Router Show Different IPs?

        Router Admin Panel ‚Üí Shows the private IP assigned by ISP (e.g., 100.64.1.5).
        What is My IP? ‚Üí Shows the public IP of ISP router (e.g., 39.50.220.14).



üìå Who Assigns Public IPs & Why Do We Have to Pay?

    Before 2010, every home got a public IP for free.
    Now, public IPv4 addresses are scarce, so ISPs sell them.
    You pay your ISP (PTCL, StormFiber, Nayatel, etc.) if you need a dedicated public IP.



üìå 0.0.0.0 vs. 127.0.0.1:

    üîπ 0.0.0.0

        Means "all available IPs" on a machine.
        Used when a server is listening on all network interfaces.

    üîπ 127.0.0.1 (Localhost)

        A special loopback address.
        Used when a device wants to talk to itself (e.g., running a local web server).



üìå How to Make a Device Accessible from the Internet?

    You need a public IP (not CG-NAT).
    Or use Port Forwarding on your home router.
    Or use a VPN like Tailscale/Cloudflare Tunnel to bypass CG-NAT.




üìå Final Takeaways

    Concept	                Explanation
    ipconfig	            Shows private IP inside LAN.

    Private IP	            Used inside local networks. Cannot be accessed from the internet.
    Public IP	            Globally unique. Used to identify devices on the internet.
    NAT	                    Translates private IPs to a public IP for internet access.
    CG-NAT	                ISP-level NAT that makes multiple homes share a public IP.
    Port Forwarding	        Allows a device to be accessed from the internet.
    0.0.0.0	                Listens on all IPs of a machine.
    127.0.0.1	            Localhost (device talks to itself).
