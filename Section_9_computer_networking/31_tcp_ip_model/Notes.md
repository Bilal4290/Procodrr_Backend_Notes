üåê TCP/IP Model Explained Simply

    Full Form: Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Model

üìå Why Do We Need the TCP/IP Model When We Have OSI Model?

    1Ô∏è‚É£ OSI Model is Theoretical, TCP/IP Model is Practical

        OSI Model was designed for understanding networking, but it‚Äôs too complex.
        TCP/IP Model was created for real-world use on the internet.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ Simplification of Layers

        OSI Model has 7 layers.
        TCP/IP Model merges some layers and has only 4 layers (easier to implement).

    3Ô∏è‚É£ The Internet Runs on TCP/IP, Not OSI

        The entire internet is built using TCP/IP protocols.
        Every website, API, or network service follows the TCP/IP model.


üì¢ OSI Model vs. TCP/IP Model (Layer Comparison)

    OSI Model (7 Layers)	TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)	    Function
    7. Application      	Application         	    Handles user interaction (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.)
    6. Presentation	        Application	                Encryption, compression, serialization
    5. Session	            Application	                Connection management between devices
    4. Transport	        Transport	                Handles TCP/UDP, port numbers, ensures data reliability
    3. Network	            Internet	                Adds IP addresses, routes data
    2. Data Link	        Network Access	            Handles MAC addresses, local network communication
    1. Physical	            Network Access	            Converts data into electrical or light signals


    üìå Major Differences
        Application, Presentation, and Session layers of OSI are merged into one layer in TCP/IP.
        Data Link and Physical layers of OSI are combined into Network Access Layer in TCP/IP.
        Transport Layer and Network Layer are same in both models.


üì§ Step-by-Step Data Flow in TCP/IP Model:

    When you send a request (e.g., opening https://google.com in a browser), data moves through 4 layers.

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer (Combines OSI Layers 5, 6, 7):

        The user interacts with applications like browsers, email clients, or APIs.
        Protocols Used:
                        HTTP/HTTPS ‚Äì Web browsing
                        SMTP ‚Äì Sending emails
                        DNS ‚Äì Resolving domain names
        Data Name:  Data
        Example:    fetch('https://example.com')

        The request is created in this layer.


    2Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer (Same as OSI Model)

        Splits data into segments (for TCP) or datagrams (for UDP).
        Adds source & destination port numbers.
        Protocols Used:
                TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ‚Äì Reliable, ordered communication.
                UDP (User Datagram Protocol) ‚Äì Fast, but unreliable (used for video streaming, VoIP).
        Data Name: Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP)
        Example:
                Source Port: 52678
                Destination Port: 443 (HTTPS)
        ‚úÖ Port numbers tell which application the data belongs to.


    3Ô∏è‚É£ Internet Layer (Same as OSI Network Layer)

        Adds source & destination IP addresses.
        Routers operate here to route packets to the correct destination.
        Protocols Used:
                        IP (Internet Protocol) ‚Äì Adds IP addresses.
                        ICMP (Ping requests) ‚Äì Checks connectivity.
        Data Name: Packet
        Example:
                Source IP: 192.168.1.10
                Destination IP: 142.250.190.46 (Google server)


    4Ô∏è‚É£ Network Access Layer (Combines OSI Data Link + Physical Layer)

        Adds MAC addresses (for local communication).
        Converts data into electrical/light signals for transmission.
        Protocols Used:
                        Ethernet ‚Äì Wired connections.
                        Wi-Fi ‚Äì Wireless connections.
        Data Name: Frame (if MAC address is added) / Bits (for transmission)
        Example:
                Source MAC: 00:A0:C9:14:C8:29
                Destination MAC: 34:77:58:2A:10:56
        ‚úÖ Now, the data is sent over the internet!


üì• How Data is Received (Decapsulation)

    When data reaches the destination (server):

        Network Access Layer ‚Äì Converts signals into bits, verifies MAC addresses.
        Internet Layer ‚Äì Reads IP address to check the correct destination.
        Transport Layer ‚Äì Reads port number to send data to the correct application.
        Application Layer ‚Äì Processes the request (Node.js, Python, etc.).


üìå Why is it Called the TCP/IP Model?

    Because it primarily uses two protocols:
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ‚Äì Ensures reliable communication.
        IP (Internet Protocol) ‚Äì Handles addressing and routing.
