=>   what is the difference between package not found and module not found


In Node.js, the errors "package not found" and "module not found" can be confusing, but they refer to different underlying issues. Here's the distinction between the two:

1. Module Not Found
What it means: This error occurs when Node.js cannot find the specific module you are trying to import (whether it's a core, local, or third-party module).

Error message: Error: Cannot find module 'module_name'

Causes:

The path to the local module is incorrect or missing.
A third-party module you’re trying to require() or import isn't installed in the node_modules directory.
A spelling mistake in the module name (e.g., 'fs' vs 'Fs').
You're trying to import a built-in Node.js module but it doesn't exist in the current environment (e.g., using a browser or older Node.js version).
Example:

js
Copy code
const express = require('express');
If you haven't installed express via npm, you'll get this error:

arduino
Copy code
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
How to fix:

For local modules: Ensure the file path is correct (use ./ for relative paths).
For third-party modules: Make sure you’ve installed the module with npm install.
For core modules: Check that the module exists and is supported in your version of Node.js.


2. Package Not Found
What it means: This error occurs when Node.js or npm cannot find the entire package, usually during package installation or lookup.

Error message: npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/package_name

Causes:

The package you are trying to install doesn’t exist in the npm registry.
The package name is spelled incorrectly.
You are trying to install a private package without the correct authentication.
The package was unpublished or removed from the npm registry.
Example:

go
Copy code
npm install non-existent-package
This will return an error like:

perl
Copy code
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/non-existent-package
How to fix:

Verify the correct spelling of the package name.
Search the npm registry to check if the package exists.
If it’s a private package, ensure you have the correct access or authentication.



=>    What is package :


What it is:

 In the context of Node.js, a package generally refers to a directory containing a package.json file, which defines a Node.js project. A package can include code (modules), metadata, and dependencies.

Purpose: 

A package is a collection of modules or functionality that can be reused in other projects. Packages can be published to the npm registry and installed by other developers.


package.json file :
{
    "type" : "module/commonjs",
    "main" : "index.js"
}


=>  Making a package which supports both CJS module or ES6 module :

        npm_modules folder
            maths folder
                package.json file
                maths.cjs
                maths.mjs


      =>   package.json file :

               {
                 "main" : "maths.cjs",
                 "module" : "maths.mjs",
                 "exports" : {
                    "import" : "./maths.mjs",
                    "require" : "./maths.cjs"
                 }
               }



=>   THOSE MODULES WHICH ARE PRESENT INSIDE NODE_MODULES FOLDER ARE CALLED NPM MODULES.
