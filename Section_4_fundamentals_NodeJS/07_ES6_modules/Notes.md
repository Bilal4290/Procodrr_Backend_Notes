=> es6 module in node js and how to enable es6 module and after enabling es6 modules then require module.exports --dirname --filename works or not and what is the scope like in common js module variables assigned to local scope and usestrict in es6 modules and what is modulescope named and default export and cjs or mjs extension


In Node.js, ES6 modules (also known as ECMAScript modules or ESM) represent a more modern approach to modularizing JavaScript code compared to CommonJS (CJS), which has been the default module system in Node.js for a long time. Let’s go over all the aspects you've asked about, step by step.

1. Enabling ES6 Modules in Node.js
   To enable ES6 modules in Node.js, you need to use one of the following approaches:

Option 1: Use the .mjs File Extension
If you name your files with the .mjs extension, Node.js will automatically treat them as ES6 modules.
Option 2: Use "type": "module" in package.json
You can use the regular .js extension but configure your project to use ES6 modules by adding "type": "module" to your package.json.
json
Copy code
{
"type": "module"
}
After enabling ES6 modules, you can use the import and export syntax in your JavaScript files.

2. CommonJS (require, module.exports) and ES6 Module Interoperability
   Once you've enabled ES6 modules (either via .mjs extension or "type": "module"), the following behavior changes:

require and module.exports: These are not available in ES6 modules. ES6 modules use the import and export syntax.

You cannot use require() to import modules in an ES6 module (mjs or when "type": "module" is set).
Similarly, module.exports does not work. Instead, you must use export and export default.
js
Copy code
// This will no longer work in an ES6 module:
const module = require('./module'); // Error
module.exports = someValue; // Error

// Instead, you need to use:
import module from './module.js'; // ES6 syntax
export default someValue;
What About **dirname and **filename?
**dirname and **filename: These are not available in ES6 modules. They are specific to CommonJS. If you need the directory name or filename in an ES6 module, you can use:

import.meta.url for getting the current file’s URL.
To convert import.meta.url to \_\_dirname-like paths, you can use the url module:
js
Copy code
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { dirname } from 'path';

const **filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const **dirname = dirname(\_\_filename);

console.log(**dirname); // Works similarly to **dirname in CJS 3. Scope in ES6 Modules
In ES6 modules, all code runs in strict mode by default. You do not need to explicitly specify "use strict" like in CommonJS modules.

Local Scope: Similar to CommonJS modules, variables defined inside an ES6 module are local to the module. They do not pollute the global scope. This means:
Each module has its own isolated scope.
You must use export to make anything available outside the module.
Example:

js
Copy code
// module1.mjs
let localVariable = "I am local";

export const exportedVariable = "I am exported";
localVariable is private to module1.mjs and cannot be accessed from other files unless explicitly exported. 4. Strict Mode in ES6 Modules
In ES6 modules, strict mode is enforced by default, so there is no need to add "use strict" at the top of your module. This helps with cleaner syntax, as the following is not necessary:
js
Copy code
// You don't need this in ES6 modules:
"use strict";

// All code is automatically in strict mode:
let x = 10; 5. Named and Default Exports
ES6 modules offer two ways to export values:

1. Named Exports
   You can have multiple named exports in a module.
   These exports must be imported using the exact names.
   Example:

js
Copy code
// module1.mjs
export const foo = "This is foo";
export const bar = "This is bar";

// Another module
import { foo, bar } from './module1.mjs';
console.log(foo); // "This is foo" 2. Default Export
A module can have only one default export.
The default export can be imported with any name.
Example:

js
Copy code
// module2.mjs
export default function greet() {
console.log("Hello, World!");
}

// Another module
import greet from './module2.mjs';
greet(); // "Hello, World!" 6. File Extensions: .mjs vs .cjs
.mjs: This is the file extension for ES6 modules. When you use .mjs, Node.js will treat the file as an ES6 module, regardless of the "type" field in package.json.

.cjs: This is the file extension for CommonJS modules. You can use .cjs to force Node.js to treat a file as a CommonJS module, even if "type": "module" is specified in package.json.

When to use .mjs and .cjs:
If your project primarily uses ES6 modules, but you still need to use some CommonJS modules, you can use .mjs for ES6 modules and .cjs for CommonJS modules.

Example of CommonJS with .cjs:

js
Copy code
// module.cjs
const message = "I am from CommonJS";
module.exports = message;
Example of ES6 with .mjs:
js
Copy code
// module.mjs
export const message = "I am from ES6 Module"; 7. Module Scope in CommonJS vs ES6
In CommonJS (CJS), each module has its own scope, and variables declared inside a module are private to that module. This applies similarly to ES6 modules.
However, the way exports are handled is different:
CommonJS: Uses module.exports and require.
ES6: Uses export and import.
Example Summarizing Everything
example.mjs (ES6 Module)
js
Copy code
// Named export
export const foo = "Hello";

// Default export
export default function greet() {
console.log("Greetings from ES6 Module!");
}
main.mjs
js
Copy code
import greet, { foo } from './example.mjs';

console.log(foo); // "Hello"
greet(); // "Greetings from ES6 Module!"
example.cjs (CommonJS Module)
js
Copy code
const bar = "Hello from CommonJS";
module.exports = bar;
main.mjs (Importing CommonJS in an ES6 module)
js
Copy code
// Importing a CommonJS module inside an ES6 module
import { createRequire } from 'module';
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
const bar = require('./example.cjs');

console.log(bar); // "Hello from CommonJS"
Summary of Key Points:
Enabling ES6 Modules: Use the .mjs extension or "type": "module" in package.json.
No require, module.exports, **dirname, or **filename: In ES6 modules, these CommonJS-specific features do not work. Use import/export and import.meta.url instead.
Strict Mode: ES6 modules are always in strict mode by default.
Named and Default Exports: ES6 modules allow both named and default exports.
File Extensions: Use .mjs for ES6 modules and .cjs for CommonJS modules.
This should cover the differences and behavior when working with ES6 modules in Node.js! Let me know if you have further questions.

=> process.cwd() :

           process.cwd() returns the current working directory from where the Node.js process was launched.

           This is the directory where you ran the Node.js command, not necessarily the directory of the script file that is currently being executed.
