=>   Basic structure of module wrapper function in NodeJS :


         (function(exports, require, module ,__filename, __dirName){
                // Module Code goes here.
         })(exports, require, module ,__filename, __dirName)






In Node.js, every JavaScript file you write is treated as a module. Node.js wraps the content of each file inside a function called the Module Wrapper Function. This is done behind the scenes and ensures that the variables, functions, and other declarations inside a file are scoped locally to that module, rather than being accessible globally.

What is the Module Wrapper Function?
When you write a JavaScript file in Node.js, Node wraps your code inside this function:

js
Copy code
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
   // Your code goes here
});
So, for example, if you create a file called app.js with the following content:

js
Copy code
console.log("Hello, World!");
Node.js will internally convert this into:

js
Copy code
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
})();
Parameters of the Module Wrapper Function:
exports: A reference to module.exports. It's used to export objects from the current module.
require: A function to import modules from other files or Node.js core modules.
module: A reference to the current module, allowing you to access its exports property.
__filename: The absolute path of the current file.
__dirname: The directory name of the current file.
Why is the Module Wrapper Function needed?
Local Scope Isolation:

By wrapping the module in a function, Node.js ensures that variables and functions defined in one file do not leak into the global scope. This prevents conflicts and ensures modularity.
Module System:

The require and exports system that allows you to import and export functionality between files is powered by this function. Each file becomes its own module.
Access to Special Variables:

The function gives access to useful special variables like __filename (the file’s path) and __dirname (the directory’s path).
Why and How Variables Go to the Local Scope:
When you define variables inside a Node.js file, due to the Module Wrapper Function, they are scoped to that specific module (i.e., the file itself), and not globally available across the entire application.

Example:

js
Copy code
let name = 'Node.js';
console.log(name);
Internally, Node wraps this code:

js
Copy code
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    let name = 'Node.js'; // This variable is scoped to this function (module)
    console.log(name);
})();
Because the name variable is inside this function, it is local to that specific module. It cannot be accessed from other files or the global scope unless you explicitly export it via module.exports.

If you want a variable to be accessible in other modules, you'd export it like this:

js
Copy code
module.exports.name = 'Node.js';
Then you can require this module in another file and access name.

In Summary:
The Module Wrapper Function in Node.js is a mechanism that wraps every module in a function to provide local scope isolation and access to important module-related parameters like exports, require, __filename, and __dirname.
Variables and functions inside a module are local to that module and cannot be accessed globally unless explicitly exported using module.exports. This prevents pollution of the global scope, helping to keep the codebase modular and maintainable.
