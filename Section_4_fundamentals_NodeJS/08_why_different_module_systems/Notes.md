The existence of different module systems in Node.js—specifically, CommonJS (CJS) and ES6 modules (ESM)—is due to the evolution of JavaScript, its ecosystem, and the way JavaScript modules were handled historically. Let’s explore the reasons behind having multiple module systems and the rationale behind their coexistence.

1. Historical Context and the Emergence of CommonJS
   Before ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript did not have a built-in module system. This posed a challenge for developers as applications grew larger and more complex. To solve the problem of organizing code and sharing functionality across files, third-party module systems emerged.

CommonJS (CJS) became the de facto standard for modules in server-side JavaScript environments, particularly in Node.js. The CJS module system introduced the following concepts:
require(): To load dependencies.
module.exports / exports: To export functionality from a module.
**dirname / **filename: To access file paths in the file system.
Node.js adopted the CommonJS module system when it was first developed because it was designed specifically for JavaScript on the server side. This system worked well, was easy to use, and was widely adopted by the Node.js community.

2. Standardization with ES6 Modules (ESM)
   In 2015, ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced a new, native module system—ES6 modules (also called ESM)—to standardize how modules work across all JavaScript environments, including both browsers and Node.js. This new module system was designed to solve some of the limitations and inconsistencies with existing third-party solutions like CommonJS and AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition). Key features of ES6 modules include:

import: To load dependencies.
export: To export functionality.
Static analysis: ES6 modules enable static analysis (parsing the module graph without running the code), allowing for better optimization like tree shaking (removing unused code).
ESM was designed to be asynchronous and more efficient compared to CJS, and it aligned with the needs of both browsers and servers (Node.js). ES6 modules have become the standard across the entire JavaScript ecosystem.

3. Why Node.js Still Supports CommonJS
   When Node.js was initially developed, CommonJS was the most practical solution available for modularity in JavaScript. The entire Node.js ecosystem, including its core modules and the vast majority of third-party packages in npm, were written in CommonJS.

By the time ES6 modules were introduced in 2015, the Node.js ecosystem had already been using CommonJS for years. Switching to a new module system was a complex and gradual process for several reasons:

Backward Compatibility
Node.js had to maintain backward compatibility with the millions of packages and projects that were built using CommonJS. Breaking the CommonJS module system would disrupt the entire Node.js ecosystem.
Even though ES6 modules are now the modern standard, many legacy packages still use CommonJS. Hence, Node.js continues to support CommonJS to ensure that existing packages can run without modification.
Different Use Cases
CommonJS is synchronous and works well in server-side environments where modules are loaded at runtime. Node.js applications often load files from the filesystem, and the synchronous nature of CommonJS allows developers to control when and how modules are loaded.
ES6 modules (ESM) are asynchronous and are optimized for browser environments, where loading modules asynchronously is a key feature to improve performance.
Dual-Module System
To address both new development practices (ESM) and the existing ecosystem (CJS), Node.js supports both CommonJS and ES6 modules. This dual-module system allows developers to choose the most appropriate module format for their project while ensuring compatibility with older packages.
