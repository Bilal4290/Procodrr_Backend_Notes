=>   Difference between module.exports and exports in nodejs :

        In Node.js, both module.exports and exports are used to export things from a module so that they can be imported and used in another file. However, they have subtle differences that can sometimes be confusing.

        Let's break it down in a simple and clear way.

          The Relationship Between module.exports and exports :

             When a module is initialized, Node.js automatically creates an empty object for module.exports, and also creates a shortcut reference to it called exports.

          Initially, both module.exports and exports point to the same object, like this:

                      // Behind the scenes
                         let exports = module.exports = {};
              
              This means that if you modify the properties of the exports object (like exports.foo = 'bar'), you’re essentially modifying the same object that module.exports points to, and the changes will be exported.

         Key Difference: module.exports is the Actual Exported Object :

              module.exports is the object that Node.js uses when you require a module. It's the object that will be returned when the module is imported somewhere else.
              exports is just a convenient shorthand to refer to module.exports.

         The critical point is:

                If you reassign module.exports, you replace the entire exported object.
                If you reassign exports, you're breaking the reference to module.exports, and the new value of exports will no longer be exported.



Example 1: Modifying the Properties of exports (Works Fine)
This works because exports and module.exports are still pointing to the same object:


// moduleA.js
exports.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
};

// main.js
const moduleA = require('./moduleA');
moduleA.greet(); // Output: Hello, world!

In this case:
We’re adding a function greet to the exports object, which is the same as adding it to module.exports.
module.exports.greet = function () {...} would also work the same.





Example 2: Reassigning module.exports (Works Fine)
This is fine because module.exports is directly set to what we want to export:


// moduleA.js
module.exports = function () {
  console.log("Hello from module.exports!");
};

// main.js
const greet = require('./moduleA');
greet(); // Output: Hello from module.exports!

In this case:
module.exports is directly assigned to a function, and that function is what will be exported.
When we require('./moduleA'), the whole function is imported.



Example 3: Reassigning exports (Breaks the Reference)
This will not work as expected:


// moduleA.js
exports = function () {
  console.log("This won't work!");
};

// main.js
const greet = require('./moduleA');
greet(); // Error: greet is not a function

In this case:
By reassigning exports, you're breaking the link between exports and module.exports. Now exports is pointing to something else (the function), but module.exports still points to the original empty object.
As a result, require('./moduleA') still returns the original, empty module.exports object, so the function isn’t exported.


Summary of Key Differences:
module.exports	exports
What is it?	The actual object that's exported and returned by require.	A shorthand reference to module.exports.
Can you reassign it?	Yes, and when you do, you control exactly what is exported from the module.	You can reassign it, but this breaks the connection to module.exports, so the changes won't be exported.
Use case	Use it when you want to export a single value (like a function or a class), or completely replace the export object.	Use it for adding properties or methods to the existing export object.
Best Practices:
Use module.exports when exporting a single entity (like a function, class, or object) to avoid confusion.
Use exports when adding multiple properties to the exported object.
In most real-world cases, if you're exporting a single item, prefer module.exports. If you're adding multiple things (like several functions), you can use exports as a shortcut to add them to the same object.
