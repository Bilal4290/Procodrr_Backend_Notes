=>   History of NodeJS :

        A developer was frustrated with the limitations of Apache HTTP server, particularly the way it handled multiple connections by creating a separate thread for each request and every request is blocking.He wanted a non-blocking, event driven architecture.

        So, he created NodeJS in 2009.
        It was a lightweight efficient system for building web applications that could handle many connections simultaneously.


        Creator of NodeJS => Ryan Dahl


        =>  Use of v8 in making NodeJS :

               Ryan Dahl choose chrome v8 engine for NodeJS because of its ability to compile JS directly into machine code, ensuring high performance and efficiency.
               This allowed NodeJS to handle concurrent connections with speed and scalability, making it ideal for building networked applications.

        
        =>  npm launch and windows support :

              The launch of npm in 2010 and windows support in 2011 broadened its adoption and increased popularity.


        =>  Contribution of Joyent in NodeJS :

               In 2012, Joyent significantly contributed to NodeJS by providing corporate sponsorship, financial support and organizational guidance, which accelerated it's development and helped it gain widespread adoption.


        =>  The birth of io.JS : 

               In 2014, io.js was created as a fork of NodeJS due to disagreements over the project's pace of development and governance, with the goal of accelerating progress and fostering greater community collaboration.


        =>   The merger of io.js and NodeJS :

                In 2015, NodeJS foundation was created to unify the io.js and NodeJS communities by providing a neutral governance structure, which facilitated the merger of the two projects and ensured collaborative, transparent development.


        =>   Modern NodeJS and LTS releases :

                The merger led to the release of NodeJS version 4.0, making the beginning of the more stable release cycle with long term support (LTS) versions, which ensured more predictable and stable updates.


        =>   OpenJS Foundation :

                In 2019, the OpenJS foundation was created by merging the NodeJS foundation and JS foundation to provide a unified, neutral home for JS projects, promoting collaborations and sustainability across the JS ecosystem.


        =>   Current state of NodeJS :

                NodeJS is now a mature and widely adopted platform that powers a vast array of applications, from small scale projects to large enterprise systems.
                The community around NodeJS remains active and vibrant, continuously contributing to its growth and improvement.
