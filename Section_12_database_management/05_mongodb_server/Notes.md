1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Mongo Shell (mongosh)?

    ‚úÖ Mongo Shell is a client-side tool used to connect to the MongoDB server (backend/database server) and execute commands.
    ‚úÖ It is written in 90% TypeScript and 5% JavaScript.
    ‚úÖ It allows developers to query, insert, update, delete data, and manage MongoDB databases.

    üìå Example: Connecting to MongoDB Server using Mongo Shell

            mongosh

    üí° This starts Mongo Shell and connects to the MongoDB server running on localhost:27017.



2Ô∏è‚É£ What is MongoDB Server (mongod)?

    ‚úÖ MongoDB Server (mongod) is the backend service that stores and manages the data.
    ‚úÖ It is written in 70% C++ and 23% JavaScript.
    ‚úÖ It runs as a TCP server, listening for client connections on port 27017 (by default).

    üìå To start the MongoDB server, run:

            mongod

    üí° This command starts the MongoDB server process.



3Ô∏è‚É£ What is mongod Command and Why Does It Require a db Folder in data folder which should be in root?

    ‚úÖ mongod is the MongoDB server executable that starts the database.
    ‚úÖ By default, MongoDB stores its data in the /data/db directory.

    üìå If the /data/db folder is missing, mongod will fail to start.


4Ô∏è‚É£ How Does Mongo Shell (mongosh) Connect to MongoDB Server (mongod)?

    ‚úÖ MongoDB Shell (mongosh) connects to MongoDB Server (mongod) over TCP (default port: 27017).
    ‚úÖ When you run mongod, it creates a server and starts listening for client connections on localhost:27017.
    ‚úÖ When you run mongosh, it connects as a client to the running server.

    üìå Connection Process:

    Start the MongoDB server (mongod).
    Run mongosh to connect to the server.
    Now, you can interact with the MongoDB database.

    üõë db

    db => an object named Database, you can see this as object by console.dir.

    db.constructor  =>  [class Database extends ShellApiWithMongoClass]
    
    db.constructor.name => Database



5Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding show Commands in Mongo Shell:

    ‚úÖ 1. What is show('databases') or show('dbs')?

        Both commands are the same:

        show databases
        # or
        show dbs

    ‚úÖ Returns a list of all available databases on the MongoDB server.

    üìå Example Output:

        admin      0.000GB
        config     0.000GB
        local      0.000GB
        myDB       0.001GB


    ‚úÖ 2. What Values Can We Pass to show()?

        MongoDB Shell allows:

            show dbs         # Show all databases
            show collections # Show collections in the current database
            show users       # Show all users
            show roles       # Show all roles
            show profiles    # Show database profiling information

    üí° You CANNOT pass custom values to show()‚Äîonly predefined ones work.


6Ô∏è‚É£ What are admin, config, and local Databases?

    Database	   Purpose
     admin	        Stores administrative commands, user roles, and authentication settings.
     config	        Stores sharding-related metadata (used in distributed setups).
     local	        Stores internal replication and operational data.

    üí° These databases are automatically created by MongoDB and should not be deleted.



7Ô∏è‚É£ What is MongoDB Compass?

    ‚úÖ MongoDB Compass is a GUI tool for MongoDB that helps developers interact with the database without using a command-line shell.
    ‚úÖ You can visualize data, run queries, and manage collections easily.
    ‚úÖ It is an alternative to Mongo Shell but with a graphical interface.

    üìå How to Connect with a Database in MongoDB Compass?

    Open MongoDB Compass.
    Enter the connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017).
    Click "Connect" to access the database.


8Ô∏è‚É£ What is MongoDB Extension for VS Code?

    ‚úÖ The MongoDB VS Code extension allows you to:

        Connect to a MongoDB database directly from VS Code.
        Run MongoDB queries inside VS Code (like Mongo Shell).
        View and modify collections easily.

    üìå To install:

        Open VS Code.
        Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X).
        Search for MongoDB and install it.
        Connect to your MongoDB database.
    üí° This helps developers manage their databases without switching to MongoDB Compass or Mongo Shell.
