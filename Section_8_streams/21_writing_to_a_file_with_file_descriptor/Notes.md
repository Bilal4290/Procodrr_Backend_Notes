📝💾 Writing to a File with File Descriptor in Node.js:

    When working with file descriptors (FD) in Node.js, we can write data to files using fs.write(). Let's break it down step by step.

1️⃣ Opening a File in Write Mode:

    To write to a file, we must first open it in write mode ('w').

        const fs = require('fs');

        const fd = fs.openSync('example.txt', 'w'); // Open file in write mode

        fs.write(fd, "Hello, this is a test!", (err, bytesWritten, writtenData) => {
            if (err) throw err;

            console.log("Bytes Written:", bytesWritten); // Number of bytes written
            console.log("Written Data:", writtenData);   // The actual written content (in buffer)
        
            fs.close(fd, () => console.log("File Closed!")); // Close the file descriptor
        });

    📝 What Happens Here?

        1️⃣ fs.openSync('example.txt', 'w') → Opens the file in write mode ('w').
        2️⃣ fs.write(fd, "Hello, this is a test!", callback) → Writes the text into the file.
        3️⃣ bytesWritten → Number of bytes successfully written.
        4️⃣ writtenData → Contains the written content as a buffer.
        5️⃣ fs.close(fd, callback) → Closes the file after writing.


2️⃣ Writing with a Buffer Instead of a String:

    Instead of a normal string, we can use a buffer for more control over memory usage.

        const buffer = Buffer.from("Writing with Buffer!");
        fs.write(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, null, (err, bytesWritten, writtenData) => {
            console.log("Bytes Written:", bytesWritten);
        });

    ✅ Buffer.from() converts a string into a buffer.
    ✅ More efficient for binary data (e.g., images, videos).

3️⃣ Understanding the Parameters of fs.write() 🧐

    fs.write(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback);

    Parameter	    Description 📖
    fd	            File descriptor
    buffer	        Buffer to write from
    offset	        Start position in buffer
    length	        Number of bytes to write
    position	    Where to write inside the file (null = append)
    callback	    Function called after writing


4️⃣ Writing at a Specific Position in a File:

    You can write data at a specific location in the file by using the position parameter.

    const buffer = Buffer.from("Hello");

    fs.write(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, 10, (err, bytesWritten) => {
        console.log(`Bytes written at position 10: ${bytesWritten}`);
    });
    💡 Writes "Hello" starting at byte index 10 in the file!


5️⃣ Overwriting vs. Appending to a File:

    📌 By default, 'w' mode overwrites the file.
    📌 Use 'a' mode to append data instead of overwriting.

    👉 Overwrite ('w' mode)
   
        const fd = fs.openSync('example.txt', 'w');
        fs.write(fd, "New Content!", () => console.log("File Overwritten!"));

        ✅ Old content is replaced with "New Content!".

    👉 Append ('a' mode)
  
        const fd = fs.openSync('example.txt', 'a');
        fs.write(fd, "\nAppending this!", () => console.log("Content Appended!"));

        ✅ Adds new data at the end of the file.


6️⃣ Using fs.writeFile() (Easier Alternative):

    Instead of fs.write(), we can use fs.writeFile(), which opens, writes, and closes in one step.

    fs.writeFile('example.txt', 'Hello from writeFile!', (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log("File Written Successfully!");
    });

    ✅ Simpler & cleaner way to write files!
    ✅ Automatically handles opening & closing.


🔚 Summary:

    ✅ fs.write(fd, data) writes to a file descriptor asynchronously.
    ✅ fs.writeSync(fd, data) does the same but synchronously.
    ✅ Use 'w' mode to overwrite & 'a' mode to append.
    ✅ Use fs.writeFile() for a simpler approach.
